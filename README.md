# QCGA_Alloys
Code to analyse Thermodynamics of allows through the Generalized Quasi-Chemical Approximation (GQCA).

# Description
The repository contains python script to perform analysis of thermodynamics of an alloys. The analysis runs on the energy of different structures that describe the configurational space of an alloys restricted to a crystallographic sueprcell.
As input the scripts need organized data ordered as followed:
1) number of the structure
2) number of specie substituted with respect to pure alloys
3) Degeneracy of the structure
4) Energy of the super cell
5)energy of the single cell.
