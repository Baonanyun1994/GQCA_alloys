# QCGA Alloy Analysis
A Python tool to analyse the thermodynamics of alloys through the Generalized Quasi-Chemical Approximation (GQCA)

# Description
The repository contains a Python script to perform analysis of thermodynamics of a solid solution as a statistical ensemble of independent structures. The analysis runs on the energy of the structures that describe the configurational space restricted to a specific crystallographic supercell.

*As input, the scripts requires:*
1) number of structures
2) number of species substituted with respect to pure end members
3) degeneracy of each structure
4) energy of the supercell configuration
5) energy of the single cell
